 - Reset more state in multiplots (xrange & yrange), avoiding a problem
     where image axis range state leaked into subsequent panels
 - Enable post-facto antialiasing for select terminals (notably pngcairo)


2.011 (released 2-April-2017)
 - Add support for PDL::Transform::Color, including photometric palettes
     (new "pseudocolor" and "perceptual" plot options)
 - Fix a regexp typo that was preventing some chatter from being suppressed under MS Windows

2.009 (released 24-Feb-2017)

 - More fixes to documentation (d-lamb's description of transparent fill)

 - Fix whitespace in the makefile.pl

 - Fix issues 57 & 61 (freezing on newer windows releases); probably also fixes 56.

 - fix issue 60 (problems with reset command making gnuplot5rc2 fail)


2.06 Codename: Fall released 1-Nov-2015

 - Minor fixes to documentation

 - Plots to output files now go to a sensible default location in the CWD,
   rather than to gnuplot's stdout.  

2.005 Codename: Spring released 6-May-2015

 - Workaround for deprecation of cairo library in MacOS 10.5

 - Correctly identify gnuplot 5.0

2.004 Codename: Dima released 20-Dec-2014

 - fixed a bug that caused version sensing to fail for alpha-builds of gnuplot.

 - Minor updates to plot option parsing (switching more options to accept hashes).

 - Several minor bug fixes.

2.003 Codename: Bug fixes released 17-Sep-2014

 - Added support for 'qt' terminal (thanks to Luis Mochan!)

 - wxt is marked as an interactive terminal ("int=>1").

 - ASCII handles NaN/binary correctly (works around gnuplot's inability to parse "NaN")

 - Curve options are not cumulative (except for "with") within a plot.

 - Deprecation of gnuplot 4.4-4.5 is now more strident

2.002 Codename: Refinements

 - removed (x|y|x2|y2|z|t)range curve options -- only plot options are supported for range spec.
   (This removes some weird corner cases in argument parsing, and doesn't affect normal plotting).

 - more permissive terminal option parsing -- omit terminal name to get the default terminal.

 - Moved changes from POD to CHANGES file


2.001 Unknown Release Date Codename: Minor Fixes

 - use object oriented checks for PDL type of arguments




2.0 Unknown Release Date Codename: Alien-Gnuplot

 - Use Alien::Gnuplot for initial contact and global configuration

 - Don't complain about 'with'-modifiers

 - Several edge-case bugs fixed (thanks, Dima)

 - Colorspec parsing is better (and regularized with a procedure call)

 - better handling of images when x2 or y2 is specified




1.5 Unknown Release Date Codename: Curve Option Cornucopia

 - complex 'with' specifiers are deprecated.

 - curve options exist for plot variants (line color etc.)

 - lines are dashed, by default

 - windows don't persist, by default

 - bad value support

 - fixed a justify problem

 - several minor cross-platform issues




1.4 Unknown Release Date Codename: Works on Windows (ick)

 - Many thanks to Chris Marshall and Juergen Mueck, who both tested endless variants as
   we troubleshot bizarre IPC problems under Microsoft Windows with Strawberry Perl.

 - default to ascii data transfer under Microsoft Windows (Juergen's hang issue)

 - do better at ignoring chatter on Microsoft Windows (intercept ascii data prompts with a regexp)

 - autoranging fix

 - read_polygon fix

 - Many small tweaks to make Microsoft Windows support better

 - Updates to POD documentation

 - Sends output to gnuplot in chunks if necessary (gets around choking limitations on some platforms)

 - Better gnuplot error reporting

 - Fixed date range handling
