2.003 Unknown Release Date (in progress) Codename: Bug fixes

 - Added support for 'qt' terminal (thanks to Luis Mochan!)

 - wxt is marked as an interactive terminal ("int=>1").

 - ASCII handles NaN/binary correctly (works around gnuplot's inability to parse "NaN")

 - Curve options are not cumulative (except for "with") within a plot.

 - Deprecation of gnuplot 4.4-4.5 is now more strident

2.002 Codename: Refinements

 - removed (x|y|x2|y2|z|t)range curve options -- only plot options are supported for range spec.
   (This removes some weird corner cases in argument parsing, and doesn't affect normal plotting).

 - more permissive terminal option parsing -- omit terminal name to get the default terminal.

 - Moved changes from POD to CHANGES file


2.001 Unknown Release Date Codename: Minor Fixes

 - use object oriented checks for PDL type of arguments




2.0 Unknown Release Date Codename: Alien-Gnuplot

 - Use Alien::Gnuplot for initial contact and global configuration

 - Don't complain about 'with'-modifiers

 - Several edge-case bugs fixed (thanks, Dima)

 - Colorspec parsing is better (and regularized with a procedure call)

 - SIGPIPE crashes fixed (mixing gnuplot and forking used to be dangerous)

 - internal representation of tics specifiers is better

 - better handling of tics when x2 or y2 is specified

 - better handling of images when x2 or y2 is specified




1.5 Unknown Release Date Codename: Curve Option Cornucopia

 - complex 'with' specifiers are deprecated.

 - curve options exist for plot variants (line color etc.)

 - lines are dashed, by default

 - windows don't persist, by default

 - bad value support

 - fixed a justify problem

 - several minor cross-platform issues




1.4 Unknown Release Date Codename: Works on Windows (ick)

 - Many thanks to Chris Marshall and Juergen Mueck, who both tested endless variants as
   we troubleshot bizarre IPC problems under Microsoft Windows with Strawberry Perl.

 - default to ascii data transfer under Microsoft Windows (Juergen's hang issue)

 - do better at ignoring chatter on Microsoft Windows (intercept ascii data prompts with a regexp)

 - clean up test reporting

 - deprecate gnuplot <4.6 and issue warning (and accommodate some missing keywords)

 - autoranging fix

 - read_polygon fix

 - Many small tweaks to make Microsoft Windows support better

 - Updates to POD documentation

 - Improved terminfo reporting

 - mouse-enabled default terminals are detected properly (e.g. 'x11').

 - includes "imag" and "points" for people who are used to PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT.

 - more careful I/O handling in the pipe

 - Improved interrupt handling

 - Sends output to gnuplot in chunks if necessary (gets around choking limitations on some platforms)

 - Allows specifying different commands than just "gnuplot" via environment variable GNUPLOT_BINARY.

 - Detects available terminal types from Gnuplot on initial startup.

 - supports m?tics options with hash syntax




1.3 Unknown Release Date Codename: Compatibility

 - Tests do not fail on v4.2 Gnuplot (still used on BSD)

 - Better error messages in common error cases

 - Several Microsoft Windows compatibility fixes (thanks, Sisyphus!)




1.2 Unknown Release Date Codename: first working release

 - Handles communication better on Microsoft Windows (MSW has brain damage).

 - Improvements in documentation

 - Handles PDF output in scripts

 - Handles 2-D and 1-D columns in 3-D plots (grid vs. threaded lines)




0.01 Unknown Release Date Codename: first release

 - Handles communication with command echo on the pipe (for Microsoft Windows)

 - Better gnuplot error reporting

 - Fixed date range handling
